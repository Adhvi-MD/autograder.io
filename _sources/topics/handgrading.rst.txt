Grading Style and Code Quality by Hand
======================================
Autograder.io provides a system for evaluating student code by hand that can
be used alongside automated test cases. The two core mechanisms available for
evaluating student code are "checkboxes," which can be used for yes/no criteria
that apply to broad parts of the source code, and "annotations," which are
pre-build comments that are applied to specific lines of the source code.

Here's an example of these two mechanisims in action:

**Override max points**: The example in this guide uses the "Start at 0 and add"
points style, which causes the maximum points possible to be computed
automatically as the sum of all *positive* checkbox points. You can override
this value by setting the "Override max points" field to the desired value.
Note that doing so will allow for "extra credit" if the number of points
awarded exceeds this value.

**"Start at max and subtract" points style**: When points style is selected,
you must specify the maximum number of points possible. Handgrading scores
will begin at this value, and you can apply deductions using checkboxes and
annotations as desired.

**Handgraders can leave comments**: Staff and admins by default can leave
arbitrary comments when handgrading student code. Checking this box will allow
:ref:`handgraders <permission-roles>` to do the same. Note that unlike
annotations, these comments do NOT have point values attached to them.

**Handgraders can adjust points**: Staff and admins by default can arbitrarily
adjust the handgrading score for a submission. Checking this box will allow
:ref:`handgraders <permission-roles>` to do the same.

Grade Submissions

Publish Grades and Rubric
-------------------------
In the "Handgrading" tab on the project admin page, check the
"Publish grades and rubric" box and click "Save" to publish handgrading scores.
A new tab will appear on the project page where students can view their score.
