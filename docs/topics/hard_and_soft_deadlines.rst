Hard & Soft Deadlines: Recommendations and Implications
=======================================================
We recommend setting the hard and soft deadlines close together,
if not to the same value. For example, you could set the soft deadline to
**8pm** and the hard deadline to **8:06pm**. This can help make the deadline
slightly less rigid while still making it feel like the deadline is actually
at 8pm.

If late day tokens are enabled and a student submits *between* the hard and soft
deadlines, a late day token will **not** be used. However, the submission page
will still notify students that a late day token will be used if they
submit. This is a side effect of the hard deadline being hidden from
students.
