Set the Hard and Soft Deadlines
-------------------------------
Autograder.io provides two deadline settings:

* **Hard Deadline**: After this passes,
  **students will no longer be able to submit their code.**
  Unlike the soft deadline, this value is **hidden from students and staff**.
  If late day tokens are allowed, submitting after this deadline will
  automatically use those tokens as appropriate.
* **Soft Deadline**: This is the deadline that is **shown to students**.
  It does NOT affect students' ability to submit their code and will not
  cause late day tokens to be used.
