Let students submit even if they're not in the roster
-----------------------------------------------------
By default, students must be explicitly listed in the student roster in order
to submit and form groups. There are two quick steps to changing this behavior:

1. Restrict guests to your email domain (Optional, once per course)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Guests are users who are allowed to submit an assignment but are not in the 
roster for the course. If your institution has a specific email domain 
(e.g. `@umich.edu`) we recommend setting the "Guest usernames must end with" 
field to that email domain.

First, navigate to the admin page for your course.

Then set the "Guest usernames must end with" field to your institution's email 
domain.

2. Enable the "Anyone with the link can submit" project option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Navigate to the admin page for your project by clicking the gear icon next to 
the project name.

Then, select the "Anyone with the link can submit" option.
